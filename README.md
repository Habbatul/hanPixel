## 📺 About the Project

**hanPixel** is a pixel-art portfolio game created using [Ebiten](https://ebiten.org/), a 2D game library for Go. This project was built from scratch to showcase fundamental game mechanics. **While some implementations are not fully modular** (maybe it's hard to read and change), the project serves as a demonstration of basic foundational game dev concepts.

### ✨ Features

* **Collision Detection.**
  Detects collisions between the player, NPCs, and obstacles.

* **Pixel-Perfect Obstacle Collisions.**
  Ensures accurate interaction with obstacles using pixel-based collision logic.

* **Render Order Logic.**
  Determines front and back object rendering dynamically for depth simulation.

* **Frame-Based Animation.**
  NPCs animate based on predefined frame sequences.

* **Zoom Factor Support.**
  Zoom level can be adjusted via code (note: current implementation could be improved).

* **Textboxes on Interaction.**
  Displays dialogue or information upon collision with certain objects or NPCs.

* **Touchscreen Support (Mobile).**
  Touch input enabled for better mobile gameplay experience.

* **Keyboard & Mouse Support (Desktop).**
  Full control support for desktop environments.
